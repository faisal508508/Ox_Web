<h1>About Me!</h1>
<h2>While studying in Japan, I didn't have the strongest English, not only having a cultural but a language barrier made it difficult to socialize. Although I gained an obsession with Minecraft, which turns out was also popular with my peers, it was my only connection with other students. I used to watch gameplay of it in Arabic, whereas the others watched English YouTubers. Nevertheless we’ve finally had a similar interest.
Later, my dad gave me his old 2007 Dell laptop and bought me Minecraft for my birthday. I was really happy as I could now play the game like the YouTubers I was watching, although it wasn’t the same. They had items and mechanics I didn’t have, which infuriated me. So I started searching and found out that they were modding their game. Then and there, I started learning how to download mods, and that’s where I believe my computer skills started to develop. The rest of the students in the class were amazed at my skills and would ask me to come over to play with them, with or without the language barrier. Later on I started trying to make my own, started with making simple texture packs and coding my own mods with the help of youtube tutorials to show off to my friends.
Going back to Saudi Arabia. I realized that my Saudi school was incredibly underdeveloped compared to my Japanese school. I demanded to speak with the principal, who then directed me to the school's founder. I told him frankly that I disliked the school and explained everything I did not like, along with suggestions for improvement, such as using technology like Kahoot! for online quizzes and incorporating games and clubs to engage students more effectively. At the same time I was working on an educational mod for minecraft to show him how a approach to implement games to teach was a viable method
He loved my ideas and told me to show off some examples, so I went back home and learned how to make Minecraft mods. I made some that revolved around lessons; sadly, they weren't implemented since they weren't as practical as I thought as a kid.
Now, in high school, I visit the elementary section and see the impact I had. Students now have access to clubs, programming classes, and competitions, more online school programs, and games to learn. Especially since a new “Minecraft educational edition” was released which I helped set up for them! I helped organise english debates, helped the computer teachers with starting a robotics and programming club, participated in the stem club, and helped with language and technical difficulties. I am a bit sad I didn't have these opportunities as a kid but I'm grateful that my little brother will have them.
I realised that language was a big issue with learning, since most resources were in English rather than Arabic, and that the devices and programs they were using weren't engaging. I wanted to make software to make it easier for people to learn, especially for non-English speakers! Not only were most of the resources available in English, Arabic resources lacked ease of use or the user interface wasn't built with Arabic in mind. Merely translating a website or a book isn't going to cut it.

So I started a software engineering internship. It was at Sahara net , a telecommunications company here in Saudi, I was working directly under the lead software engineer. At first I was working with simple HTML and CSS, later on went into databasing and making Apps with C#. Finally he showed me the process of making software or “The software development cycle”. I want to continue on this path and study software engineering at a higher level to create solutions for educational institutions. Something easy to use for both students and teachers that makes learning engaging and accessible, Especially for Arabic subjects and learners.

After my internship I created a website, which at first was for Misk students, called student wiki. It was a place for people to submit resources, notes, and advice for other students at Misk. As soon as it was created it got really popular and garnered 2000 visits a week! Students outside of misk poured in as they really needed an all in one place for notes and advice. I formed a team to help with PR and collecting resources for other students to build traction. To this day it still gets tons of engagement during test seasons, and I get recognised in public as the creator of it.
Another thing I wanted to tackle was student engagement in Computer Science, specifically programming, so I hosted a game jam to stimulate students' desire for programming and games. It was very successful having 50 contestants, 30 of them competing in real life. Tons of games were submitted, some blew my expectations away being fully hand drawn and some were published online for all to play and garnered a small fanbase. It was difficult to organise especially since it was a hybrid event, I dealt with logistics, media, PR, and judging. Then showed off my ideas to the school board and got their permission to host it at the school, they put their trust in me and gave me funding and offered teachers to help monitor both online and offline. It was difficult but they were pleased with the event. A Lot of the games had effort and love put in, friendships and connections were formed during the event, even the judges offered to hold presentations before to help the contestant in their work as they resonated with my cause to build up engagement. I feel I have made a strong impact with everyone involved, and devoted myself to help give opportunities like this to my community.
